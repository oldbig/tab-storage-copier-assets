- **Current work focus:** Submitting the extension to all major browser stores (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- **Recent changes:** Resolved a major compatibility issue with Firefox by updating `manifest.json` to set `strict_min_version` to `109.0`. This fixed all validation warnings from Mozilla's review. Also confirmed a compliant privacy policy is ready at: https://gist.github.com/oldbig/93f32b2b8e862b1adb2a554e49ed3552
- **Next steps:** Package the extension and re-submit it to the Firefox Add-ons store, ensuring the privacy policy link is included in the submission form. Also, proceed with submissions to Chrome and Edge stores.
