# Project Brief

The goal is to develop a browser extension for Chrome, with future compatibility for Edge.

The extension will allow users to copy `local storage`, `session storage`, and `cookies` from a selected source tab to a selected target tab. This will facilitate testing and development workflows by simplifying the process of transferring session and storage data between tabs.
