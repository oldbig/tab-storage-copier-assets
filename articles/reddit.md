**Body:**

Hey everyone,

If you're a web dev, you know the pain of managing browser storage. Testing different user roles often means you're stuck in a loop: log out, clear cookies, log in, repeat. It's a total workflow killer.

I got so fed up with manually copying and pasting `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `cookies` in DevTools that I built a small extension to automate it. I thought it might be useful for you all too.

It's called **Tab Storage Copier**, and it's super straightforward.

**How it works:**
1.  Open the extension popup.
2.  Pick a source tab to copy *from*.
3.  Check the boxes for the data you need.
4.  Click "Copy to Current Tab".

Done. The data is instantly synced to your active tab. It also has a "Clear" button to quickly reset your current tab's state. It's the simple tool I always wished I had.

Here’s what it looks like:

It's completely free, no ads, no tracking, just a simple tool to make our lives a little easier. It's already saved me a ton of time, and I hope it can do the same for you.

Available for all major browsers:
