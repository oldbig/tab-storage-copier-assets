**First Comment (Maker's Comment):**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the maker of Tab Storage Copier.

Like many of you, I was tired of the endless cycle of logging out and in just to test different user roles. Manually copying `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `cookies` from DevTools felt like a huge waste of time.

So, I built the tool I always wanted: a simple, fast, and reliable way to sync browser storage.

With Tab Storage Copier, you can:
✅ **Sync Storage Instantly:** One-click copy of `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `cookies`.
✅ **Simplify Testing:** Effortlessly switch between user states and environments.
✅ **Clear with Confidence:** A quick-clear button to reset your tab's state in a second.

It's a no-nonsense, lightweight tool designed to make a small but significant part of our development workflow much, much better.

It's completely free and open-source. Get it here:
*   **Chrome:** https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-storage-copier/gnbnohblpgfdellglplgpnfjpokalgen?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar
*   **Firefox:** https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-storage-copier/
*   **Edge:** https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tab-storage-copier/hfcopmhdfklplklpmpknbmaakjemeadc

I'll be here all day to answer your questions and would love to hear your ideas for what's next!
