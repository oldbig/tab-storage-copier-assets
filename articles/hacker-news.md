Hi HN,

I wrote this small extension to scratch my own itch. I was tired of the constant cycle of logging out/in or manually copying `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` / `cookies` when testing different user roles and states.

This tool makes it a one-click process: pick a source tab, check what you need, and it syncs to your active tab. It also has a quick-clear function.

It's a simple, no-frills productivity tool for developers. Hope you find it useful.

Available for all major browsers:
- Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-storage-copier/gnbnohblpgfdellglplgpnfjpokalgen?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar
- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-storage-copier/
- Edge: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tab-storage-copier/hfcopmhdfklplklpmpknbmaakjemeadc

I'm here for any questions or feedback.
